It allows users to efficiently store, retrieve, modify, and delete data. \n\n# SQL Databases:\n# SQL (Structured Query Language) databases are relational databases that use tables to store data.\n# Data is stored in a structured format with predefined schemas (tables with rows and columns).\n# Examples: MySQL, PostgreSQL, Oracle, MS SQL Server.\n\n# NoSQL Databases:\n# NoSQL databases are non-relational and can store data in various formats (key-value pairs, document-based, graph-based, etc.).\n# Data can be semi-structured or unstructured.\n# Examples: MongoDB, Cassandra, CouchDB, Redis.",
